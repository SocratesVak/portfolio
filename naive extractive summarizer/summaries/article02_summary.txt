first of a series of cyber attacks on Ukraine, including taking down government websites and putting out threatening messages, sending Ukrainians to withdraw cash from ATMs, DDoS attacks on banking, bomb threats to schools, and even a malware wiper that would erase all data in a network.': 115, 'Russia never acknowledged these attacks; but there is convincing evidence that Moscow either hires or encourages Russian hackers to conduct attacks.': 70, 'Russia has previously been implicated in cyber attacks in Ukraine, Estonia, Georgia, and the US.': 61, 'In 2014, four days before the Ukrainian parliamentary elections, malware was installed on the Ukrainian central election system, which then portrayed a pro-Russia candidate as a winner.': 43, 'This malware compromised and deleted critical

were unable to announce results for two hours.': 12, 'During these two hours, the Russian media announced that the candidate they supported had won the election with 37 percent of the votes.': 45, 'In 2015, Russian cyber troops launched remote malware attacks against Ukraine.': 82, 'A malware known as BlackEnergy targeted individuals’ emails in different energy companies.': 21, 'Once these individuals clicked on the attached malware, they activated KillDisk destructive malware which wipes out parts of the computers’ hard drives and prevents systems from rebooting.': 35, 'This led to

estimated that Russia used more than one million computers from 70 different countries in this attack.': 34, "Estonia requested help from NATO under Article V on collective defense, yet NATO was not able to offer support at that time, a situation that brought up the issue of cyberattacks as requiring the organization's collective defense.": 49, 'Later, the alliance adopted the strategic concept

attacks.': 110, 'This reduced DDoS attacks temporarily, but then hackers started to mask their IP addresses and targeted Georgian services on foreign hosts.': 64, 'For example, Russian hackers attacked   US-based servers with DDoS after the Georgian government migrated their server to a private web server in Atlanta.': 71, 'After the Russian DDoS cyber attack, many pro-Georgia hackers started counter-attacks against Russian servers, including a few Russian media sites.': 119, 'But with Russian websites, communication, and news blocked, Georgian citizens soon drowned in an information blackout.': 63, 'The media censoring and internet filtering created panic and helped spread rumors and disinformation about a Russian victory.': 47, 'The Georgian government was unable to debunk false news or to connect with its citizens.': 42, 'The state of confusion and suspicion had a significant effect on morale, which reflected on the battlefield.': 16, 'In this war, Russia

targeted Russian TV channels to show pro-Ukrainian messages, while a Telegram channel had been formed with thousands of members fighting online for Ukraine.': 121, 'Unlike Georgia in 2008, Ukraine is backed electronically by NATO and its neighbours.': 34, 'After Russia moved its troops toward Kyiv, NATO signed an agreement with Ukraine to enhance its cyber capabilities and give it access to the alliance’s malware information sharing platform.': 79, 'The White House also offered the Ukrainian government cyber support.': 44, 'Elon Musk offered his satellite broadband service, Starlink, to run

businesses and citizens.': 53, 'Despite attempts by Ukraine to return the attack, it is difficult to assess their success.': 26, "One possible indication could be dated to May 9, when hackers interrupted Putin's speech on TV during the celebration of Victory Day.": 27, 'On that day, Russia smart TV users’ and online viewer saw the names of their TV programmes changed to “The blood of

caused moderate harm to Ukraine’s digital infrastructure.': 56, 'Both parties have made mistakes similar to the ones experienced in Georgia.': 17, 'Putin recently blocked all Western media websites

president also banned on March 20 eleven left-wing opposition parties accused of supporting Russia; these parties have 10 percent of the seats in the national parliament.': 52, 'In addition to
