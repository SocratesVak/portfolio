We clearly cannot be going to demonstrations with the same flag that hangs above the buildings of Russian embassies and in the Kremlin

Alexey Sidorenko, head of the non-governmental organization Teplitsa that supports civic activism in Russia, shares Litvin's views in an interview with Global Voices:

In 2014 [the year of Russia's occupation of Crimea] I felt that it became physically impossible to march in demonstrations in Europe under the tricolor flag. He is one of the cofounders of the Prague Anti-war Committee (Пражский антивоенный комитет) and told Global Voices why it is important for Russians living abroad and opposed to Putin to have their own flag:

Those [Russians] who do not recognize the BSB flag are obviously those who do not take part in demonstrations in Europe and elsewhere. The rationale behind the BSB flag is that it removes the lower red strip that symbolizes blood, violence or, for some, Communism, and offers a peaceful, non-imperialistic symbol for Russians denouncing Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, and wanting to build a democratic, non-colonial Russian society and state.
